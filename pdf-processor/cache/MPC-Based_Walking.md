## Abstract & Key Contributions

### 🎯 Core Algorithm
This paper proposes an **algorithm** capable of regenerating gait patterns online using the **Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework** with the **Linear Inverted Pendulum Model** as the predictive model basis.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The **method** divides ZMP (Zero Moment Point) constraints into three phases:
- **Single-leg support phase**
- **Double-leg support phase** 
- **Start-end transition phases**

### 🎛️ Control Innovation
The **approach** reformulates constraints into a complete **quadratic programming problem**, enabling:
- **Foot placement adjustments**
- **Step timing optimization**
- **Dynamic stability maintenance**

### Problem Statement
After years of research, many robots are deployed in practical applications, with most being stationary robots and wheeled robots. Due to their structural design, these robots are limited to specific environments, such as factories and warehouses.

### 🤖 Real-World Applications
**Boston Dynamics Stretch Example**:
- Load-carrying capacity: Up to 800 boxes per hour
- **Limitation**: Restricted to flat environments due to wheeled structure

**Agility Robotics Cassie Example**:
- **Terrain Capability**: Stairs, sidewalks, rural roads
- **Performance**: Walking speed up to 5 km/h
- **Advantage**: Excellent adaptability to various terrains

### 🔬 Technical Foundation
The stability of humanoid robots during walking is typically determined by whether the **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)** remains within the support polygon.

$$
ZMP = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i g x_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i \alpha_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i g}
$$

Where:
- `m_i`: Mass of body segment i
- `g`: Gravitational acceleration  
- `x_i`: Position of center of mass
- `I_i`: Moment of inertia
- `α_i`: Angular acceleration

## 🔧 MPC Framework Implementation

### State Space Representation
The **Linear Inverted Pendulum Model** is formulated as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
x_{k+1} \\ 
\dot{x}_{k+1} 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & T \\ 
0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 
x_k \\ 
\dot{x}_k 
\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix} 
T^2/2 \\ 
T 
\end{bmatrix} u_k
$$

### Cost Function Formulation
The MPC optimization problem minimizes:

$$
J = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \left( ||x_k - x_{ref}||_Q^2 + ||u_k||_R^2 \right) + ||x_N - x_{ref}||_P^2
$$

### Implementation Pseudocode
```python
def mpc_walking_controller(current_state, reference_trajectory, constraints):
    """

    Args:
        current_state: Current robot state [position, velocity]
        reference_trajectory: Desired walking trajectory
        constraints: ZMP and contact force constraints
    
    Returns:
        optimal_control: Control inputs for next time step
    """
    
    # 1. Predict future states using Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
    predicted_states = predict_states(current_state, prediction_horizon)
    
    # 2. Formulate quadratic programming problem
    cost_matrix = build_cost_function(predicted_states, reference_trajectory)
    constraint_matrix = build_zmp_constraints(support_phase)
    
    # 3. Solve optimization problem
    optimal_control = solve_qp(cost_matrix, constraint_matrix)
    
    # 4. Apply pressure sensor feedback
    adjusted_control = adjust_for_pressure_distribution(optimal_control)
    
    return adjusted_control
```
